# VirtualAssistant
Before using 'Jarvis.py', make some changes so that it can work better
1. Download and import all required packages before running it as I haven't uploaded virtual environment files.
2. In send_email() function, provide the email and password (account from which you want to send email) in account and password respectively, all in lower letters
3. Add name and email id's (of recipient) in 'emails' dictionary.


Here are some features that you can try:
1. You can ask assistant (JARVIS :P) to search on wikipedia.
2. Play music.
3. Talk to assistant.
4. Facts.
5. Send emails
